# TheFacts

TheFacts is a decentralized, censorship resistant and pay per post news, articles and fact sharing mobile application. The application uses Ethereum based smart contracts
and Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) to store the application content.

### To build it check out respective frontend and backend directory.

## Idea

The core idea was to have a censorship resistance and decentralized news sharing platform where in users can submit posts related to any topic and incase of wrong information
being provided, the users can add threads to that particular post in support or against it. The publishers of the post can earn Ethereum based crypto tokens when anybody chooses
to view their post. The threads in a post also can be upvoted by other users and depending on the number of upvotes, the publisher of the thread can also earn incentives.

## Business Model

Posting of an article/post will be completely free. The users will be displayed a thumbnail and title for every post on the home page and they can choose to pay for the post they
like and view the full content along with all the threads and also they can contribute to that particular post by submitting their own thread. For every purchase of a post, there
will be fees which the publisher has to pay (it is automatically deducted by the smart contract). That fees will be utilized to pay gas fees for the services and maintenance of the
application. The incentives for the threads will also be paid from part of the fees collected.
